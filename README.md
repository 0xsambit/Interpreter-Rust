# Interpreter-Rust

This project is a Rust-based interpreter that allows you to execute custom scripts and programs written in a specific programming language.

## Features

- Lightweight and efficient interpreter written in Rust.
- Supports a custom programming language with its own syntax and semantics.
- Provides a command-line interface for executing scripts and programs.
- Offers a set of built-in functions and libraries for common programming tasks.
- Easily extensible with the ability to add new features and libraries.

## Getting Started

To get started with Interpreter-Rust, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Interpreter-Rust.git`
2. Install Rust: Visit the official Rust website (https://www.rust-lang.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
3. Build the project: Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run `cargo build` to build the interpreter.
4. Run a script: Use the command `cargo run -- script_path` to execute a script or program. Replace `script_path` with the path to your script file.

## Syntax and Semantics

The custom programming language used by Interpreter-Rust has its own syntax and semantics. Please refer to the documentation for detailed information on how to write scripts and programs in this language.
